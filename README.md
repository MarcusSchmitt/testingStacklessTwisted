# testingStacklessTwisted
I created this repository to play around with stackless python in combination with the Twisted library. <br />
Stackless Python: <br />
https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/wiki/Home  <br />
Twisted: <br />
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/  <br />

I found a basic introduction on how to make stackless play nice with twisted from Stephen Coursen:  <br />
https://www.stevecoursen.com/209/stackless-python-meets-twisted-matrix/  <br />
I think this is a pretty good starting point for everyone who wants to play around with stackless+twisted
