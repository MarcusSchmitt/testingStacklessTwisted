# testingStacklessTwisted
I created this repository to play around with stackless python in combination with the Twisted library.
Stackless Python:
https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/wiki/Home
Twisted:
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/

I found a basic introduction on how to make stackless play nice with twisted from Stephen Coursen:
https://www.stevecoursen.com/209/stackless-python-meets-twisted-matrix/
I think this is a pretty good starting point for everyone who wants to play around with stackless+twisted
